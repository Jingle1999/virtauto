# Decision Trace — PR-575 — Add production process section with stages 1–6

- **PR:** #575
- **Branch:** Jingle1999-patch-472788
- **Change type:** Documentation / Spec update (normative UI spec)
- **Scope:** `industrymodel.html`
- **Risk level:** Low (content + structure only, no runtime logic)
- **Decision class affected:** `industrymodel_spec_v1` (documentation artifact)
- **Governance posture:** PR-only, audit-first, no silent claims

---

## 1) Intent
Make the Industry Model credible for practitioners by adding the **real production flow (Stages 1–6)** for a BIW doorline:
from inner panel → outer panel → hemming/folding → joining/welding → inspection → release/hand-over.
The goal is to show that the bounded decision model can map to a realistic doorline work-group structure.

---

## 2) What changed
- Added an explicit **Production Process (Stages 1–6)** section to `industrymodel.html`.
- Each stage includes:
  - brief description of operations,
  - typical resources (operator / robot / tooling),
  - expected signals/evidence (what must be logged/scanned),
  - quality / safety checkpoints.

No changes to governance workflows, agents, scripts, or enforcement logic.

---

## 3) Constraints & non-negotiables checked
- **No new capability claims** without governed artifacts (“No artifact, no capability” remains enforced).
- **No autonomous execution** introduced (advisory-only posture remains).
- Spec remains consistent with:
  - bounded decision space (Stage 1),
  - explicit BLOCK legitimacy,
  - audit-first trace discipline.

---

## 4) Evidence (repo pointers)
- **Primary edited artifact**
  - `industrymodel.html`

- **Existing governed baseline artifacts (unchanged by this PR)**
  - `governance/contracts/pp-door-release-v1.md`
  - `ops/reports/decision_trace.jsonl`
  - `ops/decisions/gate_result.json`
  - `ops/reports/system_status.json`

- **This PR decision trace**
  - `decision_traces/pr-575.decision_trace.md`

---

## 5) Decision
**APPROVE** merging this PR once required checks pass.

**Rationale**
- Change is documentation/spec structure only.
- Improves realism and interpretability of the Industry Model by mapping to a real doorline stage flow.
- Does not weaken governance posture or introduce unguided autonomy.

---

## 6) Expected outcome after merge
- `industrymodel.html` provides a clear, stage-based doorline process narrative (Stages 1–6),
  making the model verifiably applicable to a realistic BIW doorline setup.
- Governance checks remain unchanged and enforceable.
