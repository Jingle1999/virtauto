# Decision Trace — PR-572 — Update industrymodel.html

## Trace Metadata
- trace_id: pr-572-industrymodel-energy-stage-1-1
- related_pr: #572
- actor: GEORGE
- phase: governance
- decision_class: energy_output_stability_advisory / energy_peak_mitigation_advisory
- mode: advisory-only
- timestamp_utc: 2026-02-17T13:55:00Z

---

## Intent

Integrate Stage 1.1 (Energy Optimization – bounded advisory) into `industrymodel.html`
without changing execution authority or shopfloor autonomy level.

This update:
- Introduces advisory-only energy decision classes for Door Model 2 and 3.
- Links governance artifacts (contracts, rules, examples).
- Keeps execution strictly non-autonomous.
- Preserves conservative defaults.

---

## Scope

File modified:
- industrymodel.html

No changes to:
- execution control layer
- runtime gate logic
- authority matrix
- autonomy score logic
- system_status.json structure

---

## Governance Artifacts Referenced

- governance/contracts/energy-output-stability-advisory-v1.md
- governance/contracts/energy-peak-mitigation-advisory-v1.md
- governance/rules/biw-door-energy-v1.json
- ops/examples/energy_output_stability_advisory.json
- ops/examples/energy_peak_mitigation_advisory.json

---

## Authority Model

Decision class: Advisory-only

- No autonomous execution
- No actuation on shopfloor
- No override of blocking gates
- Human review required for operational adoption

---

## Evidence Posture

Conservative default maintained:

- Missing evidence → BLOCK
- No artifact → No capability claim
- No execution without trace

This PR does not increase autonomy.
It only exposes governed advisory capability in the Industry Model specification.

---

## Risk Assessment

Risk Level: LOW

Rationale:
- Static HTML update
- No pipeline logic change
- No runtime behavior change
- No contract schema change

---

## Outcome

Industry Model now reflects:

Stage 1.1 — Energy Optimization (bounded advisory)
for BIW Doorline Model 2 and Model 3.

Governance integrity preserved.
Execution layer unchanged.
Autonomy unchanged.
