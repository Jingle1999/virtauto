## Intent

Make the "Core Agents & Layers" section dynamically render all agents defined in:

ops/reports/system_status.json → agents{}

Remove hardcoded UI ordering to ensure future agents appear automatically without manual index.html changes.

---

## Proposed Change (What)

1. Remove static `const order = [...]` agent definition from `status/index.html`.
2. Introduce dynamic rendering logic:
   - Iterate over `data.agents`
   - Generate cards via view model
   - Sort by role priority, then alphabetically
3. Preserve governance invariants:
   - No modification of truth artifacts
   - UI remains read-only consumer of `system_status.json`

---

## Evidence (Why justified)

- system_status.json already includes new agent: "consistency".
- UI previously depended on static ordering and therefore did not render new agents.
- Dynamic rendering ensures:
  - Future extensibility
  - Governance consistency
  - Elimination of manual UI drift

---

## Risk Assessment

- Risk level: LOW
- No change to:
  - ops/reports/system_status.json
  - decision trace artifacts
  - autonomy logic
  - governance checks
- Pure presentation-layer change.

Failure mode:
- If rendering fails → UI shows no cards (safe failure).
- Truth source remains intact.

---

## Authority & Governance

Required checks:
- decision_trace_required: true ✅
- status_validation_required: true ✅

Gate verdict: ALLOW  
Change classification: supervised UI change

No autonomous system-level modification introduced.

---

## Alternatives Considered

1. Continue manually updating `const order` → rejected (non-scalable).
2. Generate UI from registry.yaml → rejected (UI must remain truth-source driven).

Chosen approach:
Direct rendering from canonical truth artifact.

---

## Outputs (explicit)

- status/index.html (dynamic rendering logic introduced)
- decision_traces/pr-578.decision_trace.md (this file)

---

## Expected Result

- validate_pr_decision_trace passes.
- New agents (e.g., "consistency") render automatically.
- UI becomes future-proof against agent additions.
