## Intent

Update `ops/reports/system_status.json` with new values to reflect
current runtime state and agent configuration.

The change must:

- remain consistent with governance contract
- preserve schema validity
- not alter autonomy boundaries
- keep UI truth-lock intact

---

## Proposed Changes (What)

1. Update `ops/reports/system_status.json`:
   - refresh `generated_at`
   - update metrics / health values
   - keep governance.required_checks unchanged
2. No changes to:
   - governance contracts
   - authority matrix
   - decision enforcement logic

---

## Evidence

- `ops/reports/system_status.json` remains valid JSON
- `governance.required_checks.decision_trace_required = true`
- No structural changes to:
  - `agents/registry.yaml`
  - `ops/reports/decision_trace.jsonl`
- Consistency Agent v1 passes locally

---

## Risk Assessment

- Risk Level: LOW
- Scope: data update only
- No autonomous behavior introduced
- No contract or schema modifications

Failure mode:
- If JSON invalid → CI fails (validate_status)
- If trace missing → validate_pr_decision_trace fails

---

## Authority & Governance

Required checks:

- decision_trace_required: true  ✅ (this artifact)
- status_validation_required: true ✅

Gate verdict:
- ALLOW (bounded, supervised update)

---

## Outputs (Required for downstream validation)

outputs:
  - ops/reports/system_status.json
  - decision_traces/pr-577.decision_trace.md

---

## Expected Result

- validate_pr_decision_trace → PASS
- validate_status → PASS
- Status page renders updated truth source
- Governance remains enforced
