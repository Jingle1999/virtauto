# Phase 8 — Exit Statement

Phase 8 is considered complete.

The system now guarantees:
- Deterministic failover for all critical capabilities
- No agent is a single point of failure
- Failover behavior is rule-based and traceable
- Resilience does not increase autonomy

Open topics intentionally deferred:
- Self-healing strategies (Phase 9)
- Memory and learning (Phase 10)
- Night shift consolidation (Phase 11)

Any further changes must respect this boundary.
