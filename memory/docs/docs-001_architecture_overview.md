# virtauto.OS — Architecture Overview (V1.0 Seed)

## Purpose
This document provides a concise overview of the core architectural layers of virtauto.OS — the world’s first agentic website operating with real-time autonomy, self-monitoring, and self-protection.

---

## 1. System Layers
virtauto.OS is composed of four core layers:

### A. Agent Layer
Autonomous operational units for:
- security enforcement  
- monitoring  
- content generation  
- compliance evaluation  
- deployment preparation  

Agents act through GitHub workflows, rules, and event triggers.

---

### B. Orchestration Layer (GEORGE)
Responsibilities:
- Determine which agent should act  
- Maintain global coherence  
- Route tasks and intents  
- Prevent conflicting actions  
- Execute orchestration rules  

---

### C. Knowledge Layer (RAG Memory)
Long-term memory built from:
- architecture docs  
- agent specs  
- system status reports  
- Medium articles by Andreas Braun  

Supports:
- safer decision-making  
- consistent content generation  
- institutional knowledge retention  

---

### D. Cognitive Digital Twin (Concept Stage)
Future global system intelligence:
- long-term intent  
- predictive capabilities  
- system-wide strategic reasoning  

---

## 2. Autonomy Model
Current autonomy: ~50%  
Includes:
- automatic compliance checks  
- content draft generation  
- system health monitoring  
- guardian-based security workflows  

Target → 70–80% autonomous operations.

---

## 3. Roadmap Summary
- Activate deploy + content agents  
- Finalize GEORGE rules  
- Expand RAG memory  
- Reach production-grade autonomy
