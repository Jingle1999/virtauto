# Decision Trace

## Decision / Intent
Introduce an explicit, deterministic detector for regression type R1
(Capability Graph Invalid) as part of Phase 9 Self-Healing.

## Authority
System governance – Phase 9 implementation.

## Scope
Files affected:
- self_healing/detectors/detect_capability_regression.py

## Expected Outcome
R1 regressions become explicitly detectable, audit-visible, and
machine-verifiable without changing system autonomy.
