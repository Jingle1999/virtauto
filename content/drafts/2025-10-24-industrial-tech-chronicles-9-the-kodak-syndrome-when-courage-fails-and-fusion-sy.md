<h2>Industrial Tech Chronicles #9: The Kodak Syndrome – When Courage Fails and Fusion Systems Never Happen</h2><p>The Digital Transformation of the Automotive Industry. When Software builds Hardware.</p><p>“Transformation doesn’t always succeed – but understanding why it fails may be the most important lesson of all.”</p><p><strong>1. Introduction</strong></p><p>In 1975, a young Kodak engineer named Steven Sasson built something extraordinary: the world’s first digital camera. It weighed eight pounds, captured a 0.01-megapixel image, and stored it on a cassette tape. When he presented his invention to Kodak’s executives, their reaction was not awe – it was fear.</p><p>“Why would anyone ever want to look at their pictures on a screen?” one executive asked. Another worried aloud: “But won’t this hurt our film business?”</p><p>That question – not any technological limitation – sealed Kodak’s fate. The company that once defined photography would file for bankruptcy in 2012. And yet, the tragedy of Kodak is not about ignorance. It’s about fear – the fear of killing a profitable past to create an uncertain future.</p><p>Welcome to the Kodak Syndrome: the paralysis that occurs when corporations possess the technology of the future but lack the courage to use it.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/512/1*Z-WIcevywfQIJpzRMcFjyg@2x.jpeg" /></figure><p><strong>2. The Illusion of Adaptation: When “Digital” Isn’t “Transformation”</strong></p><p>Kodak did not ignore digital technology. It patented dozens of digital innovations, acquired imaging startups, and even introduced online photo services. Yet, none of these efforts changed its trajectory. Why? Because they never touched the company’s core.</p><p>Like many incumbents, Kodak confused digitization with digital transformation. It built websites and launched digital cameras – but all within the logic of its traditional business model. The goal was still to sell prints, film, and chemicals. The “digital” layer was cosmetic, not structural.</p><p>True transformation, however, is not about adding digital tools to old habits. It’s about fusing the old and the new into a single, self-reinforcing system – one that redefines how value is created and captured.</p><p>Kodak’s leaders failed to grasp this distinction. They tried to graft digital branches onto a dying tree, instead of planting a new one.</p><p><strong>3. The Heart of Transformation: Business Model Innovation</strong></p><p>At the center of every lasting transformation lies Business Model Innovation (BMI) – the deliberate reinvention of what a company offers, how it delivers it, and how it makes money.</p><p>Kodak’s business model had long followed the “razor and blades” formula: sell cameras cheaply, and profit from film and development. For decades, this worked brilliantly. But digital photography flipped that logic. Once images became bits, not atoms, the recurring revenue from film vanished.</p><p>Rather than designing a new value engine, Kodak clung to the old one. It introduced photo-print kiosks to encourage users to print digital pictures – a desperate attempt to keep the film era alive.</p><p>What Kodak could have built was entirely different: a visual storytelling ecosystem – combining cameras, software, cloud storage, and sharing platforms. Apple and Instagram eventually did exactly that, creating value not through film or prints, but through experience, identity, and connectivity.</p><p>This is the essence of BMI: shifting the profit formula from products to platforms, from transactions to ecosystems. Kodak had every ingredient to do this first – brand, trust, and technical know-how. What it lacked was the will to cannibalize its cash cow.</p><p>“Real innovation doesn’t fit the old P&amp;L sheet. It eats it.”</p><p><strong>4. The Promise (and Failure) of Fusion Systems</strong></p><p>In their book Fusion Strategy, Vijay Govindarajan and Venkat Venkatraman argue that the future belongs to fusion systems – architectures that seamlessly combine physical and digital strengths into one coherent value system.</p><p>A fusion system is not just digital transformation layered on top of legacy operations. It is the integration of traditional assets (brand, logistics, customer relationships, manufacturing excellence) with new digital capabilities (data, AI, platforms, ecosystems) to create exponential, rather than incremental, value.</p><p>Kodak could have become a model fusion company – blending its optical expertise, distribution network, and brand with the new digital economy of creativity and sharing. Instead, it remained a film company dabbling in pixels.</p><p><strong>5. Why do fusion systems fail to emerge?</strong></p><p>Three intertwined forces explain it:</p><p>5.1 Cultural Resistance &amp; Inertia: Organizations are built to execute the old model efficiently, not to imagine a new one. Every process, incentive, and mindset reinforces yesterday’s success.</p><p>5.2 Short-Term Pressure: Public companies live by quarterly results. Transformations require temporary decline before rebirth – a price few CEOs dare to pay.</p><p>5.3 Fear of Self-Cannibalization: The most profitable parts of the business are often the ones that must die first. Kodak’s film division funded everything – including its future demise.</p><p>When these forces align, courage collapses, and fusion systems never happen.</p><p><strong>6. Courage as a Strategic Imperative</strong></p><p>Technology is rarely the limiting factor in transformation. Strategy sometimes is. But courage – the willingness to sacrifice today’s profits for tomorrow’s relevance – is almost always the missing ingredient.</p><p>It takes courage to disrupt oneself before being disrupted.</p><p>It takes courage to embrace uncertainty when quarterly targets punish experimentation.</p><p>And it takes courage to lead with conviction when the data still favors the old world.</p><p>Kodak’s executives weren’t blind; they were cautious. But in strategy, excessive caution is just another form of risk – the slow, invisible kind.</p><p>Business Model Innovation, not technology adoption, is where real transformation begins. Fusion happens only when leaders are willing to tear down walls between old and new, analog and digital, short-term and long-term.</p><p>As the late Clay Christensen observed, the hardest part of innovation isn’t creating new ideas – it’s letting go of the old ones.</p><p><strong>7. The Broader Lesson</strong></p><p>Kodak’s downfall is not a historical curiosity. It’s a mirror for every incumbent today facing the same dilemma – from automotive OEMs caught between combustion and electrification, to energy giants balancing fossil and renewable portfolios, to banks debating the blockchain.</p><p>Every industry now lives its own version of the Kodak Syndrome: the fear of fusion.</p><p>The true enemy of transformation isn’t technological debt – it’s psychological debt.</p><p>Companies that survive the next decade will be those that see fusion not as a threat but as a design principle – systems that continuously integrate physical assets, digital capabilities, and human judgment.</p><p>This is why GE’s story (from our previous chapter) still matters: despite its failures, it found the humility to rebuild a digital foundation. The next frontier belongs to those who combine that humility with courage.</p><p>Next week, we’ll explore a surprising example of such courage: Walmart – a company that defied expectations by transforming itself into a data-driven retail ecosystem. Walmart’s journey shows that even the most traditional business can fuse its physical muscle with a new digital engine – if leadership dares to move first.</p><p><strong>8. Final Reflection</strong></p><p>Kodak didn’t die because it failed to predict the future. It died because it refused to live in it.</p><p>The lesson is timeless: In the age of Digital Transformation, courage is strategy.</p><img alt="" height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=8fbbd7877517" width="1" />
