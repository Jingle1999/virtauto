# Content Agent (stub)

This folder will hold Content Agent routines (e.g., RSS ingestion from Medium, teaser generation,
internal linking suggestions).

Suggested next steps:
- Create `medium_ingest.py` to fetch latest Medium posts and generate HTML snippets.
- Add `headlines_ab_test.md` to track A/B experiments.
- Store proposed internal links in `content/internal_links.md` for review by Consistency Agent.
